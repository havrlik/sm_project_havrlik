## About

My personal project, where I learned **Java basics**. 
Founded at 2017.

## The application

Simple app, where you can:

- Get a list of files on your disk.
- Create audio playlist `.m3u`.
- Rename files on your disk.

A library of the app allows easily:

- Read files and handle a content.
- Work with lists of values by the custom list.
- Show table to a user.
- Log messages for a user.

## Run

- Use the source code as a Java project.
- Set these sources as build path: smlib, filefixtures.
- Run the main method `main.java.project.havrlik.soft.filefixtures.Main_FileFixtures.main()`.

## Environment

Tested on Linux and Windows. On Mac, the GUI is not fine.
